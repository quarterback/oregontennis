# Regional Bracket Format: Feasibility Analysis

## Data Source
- 1,381 playoff games from 2014-2025 (baseball and softball)
- All 5 OSAA divisions (6A, 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A/1A)
- 865 games (63%) required 95+ miles of travel

## Key Questions Analyzed

### 1. Does Strict Seeding Produce Correct Outcomes?

| Round | % Top-8 Seeds | Implication |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| First Round | 33% | By design - only some top-8 play R1 |
| Second Round | 49% | Upsets happening |
| Quarterfinals | 85% | Seeding mostly works |
| Semifinals | 92% | Top teams advance |

**Finding:** Seeding "works" but 15% of QF spots go to non-top-8 seeds. In baseball/softball, this variance is normal due to sport randomness.

### 2. What is the Travel Cost of Strict Seeding?

**Current First Round Format:**
- 73% of matchups cross geographic regions
- Average cross-region distance: 176 miles
- Average same-region distance: 50 miles

**Worst First Round Travel Cases:**
| Distance | Matchup | Year/Sport |
|----------|---------|------------|
| 387 mi | Bandon vs Joseph | 2022 Baseball 2A/1A |
| 346 mi | Hidden Valley vs McLoughlin | 2016 Softball 4A |
| 341 mi | Vale vs Taft | 2023 Softball 3A |
| 331 mi | Hidden Valley vs La Grande | 2022 Baseball 4A |

### 3. Regional Pod Potential

**Concept:** Allow seeds 9-16 to swap opponents within bracket halves based on geography.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Potential savings per regionalized game | 126 miles |
| Realistic annual savings | ~40,000 miles |
| Games affected | ~60% of first round |

### 4. Does Travel Affect Competitive Outcomes?

| Category | Teams Making Semifinals |
|----------|------------------------|
| High travel (400+ mi in early rounds) | 47 |
| Low travel (<200 mi) | 87 |

**Finding:** Eastern Oregon teams CAN succeed despite travel burden, but at significant cost to student-athletes (missed school, fatigue, expense).

## Recommendations

### For Baseball/Softball
1. Consider regional first-round matchups for seeds 9-16
2. Protect top-8 seed bracket positions
3. Could reduce travel by 40-50% with minimal competitive impact

### For Tennis (Combined 4A/3A/2A/1A)
Tennis has even MORE geographic spread and a multi-day format that compounds travel burden.

**Proposed Format:**
1. **East/West Regional Pods** for first 2 rounds
2. **Central Neutral Site** (Salem/Albany area) for semifinals and finals
3. This mirrors formats used by other states successfully

## Supporting Data

### Eastern Oregon Travel Burden (2014-2025)

| Team | Long-Haul Games | Avg Miles | Burden |
|------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Nyssa | 6 | 311 mi | Extreme |
| Joseph | 9 | 308 mi | Extreme |
| Enterprise | 11 | 291 mi | High |
| Vale | 22 | 291 mi | High |
| Ontario | 9 | 280 mi | High |
| Union | 22 | 277 mi | High |
| McLoughlin | 19 | 253 mi | High |
| La Grande | 33 | 246 mi | Moderate |

### Worst Turnaround Cases (Multiple Long-Haul in Same Playoff)

| Team | Year | Sport | Total Miles |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| La Grande | 2017 | Baseball 4A | 1,120 mi |
| Vale | 2014 | Softball 3A | 1,103 mi |
| Union/Cove | 2014 | Softball 2A/1A | 1,102 mi |
| McLoughlin | 2016 | Softball 4A | 1,096 mi |
| Henley | 2019 | Baseball 4A | 1,015 mi |

*Note: OSAA playoffs have only 3-4 days between rounds, compounding the burden.*
